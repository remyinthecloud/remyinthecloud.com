# Remy in the Cloud  

Welcome to the repository for [Remy in the Cloud](https://remyinthecloud.com) ‚Äî my personal website and a hub for documenting my learning journey, projects, and experiments in tech.  

---

## ‚ú® Purpose  

This site is designed to help me:  
- **Document my homelab and technical projects** in detail.  
- **Share blog posts** on lessons learned in DevOps, Kubernetes, Linux, and cloud technologies.  
- Build the habit of **writing and archiving knowledge** to support continuous learning.  

It's my tool for personal growth, reflection, and practicing best DevOps principles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

Here's how the site is built and deployed:  

- **Framework:** Built using **Jekyll** to transform Markdown files into HTML and CSS.  
- **Hosting:** The static site is hosted in an **AWS S3 bucket** for durability and scalability.  
- **CI/CD:** Updates are automated with **GitHub Actions**, ensuring the latest content is deployed seamlessly.  
- **Domain:** Managed through **AWS Route 53**, connected to the hosted site.  
- **Local Workflow:** All development is done on my **Ubuntu home server**, making it part of my larger homelab ecosystem.  
- **Security:** An **AWS IAM user** with scoped permissions ensures secure access to the S3 bucket.

## üöÄ Homelab and DevOps Practices  

My **Kubernetes homelab** is a major focus of this project. It‚Äôs an environment where I:  
- Emulate **enterprise-level workflows**, with staging and production environments.  
- Practice **automation** through tools like GitOps (using ArgoCD) and CI/CD pipelines.  
- Monitor and optimize the setup using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for metrics and alerts.  
- Build and operate with **best DevOps practices**, such as:  
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
  - Detailed and accessible **documentation** for everything I build.  
  - Streamlining workflows to reduce manual effort and increase reproducibility.  

This website serves as a documentation platform for my homelab and is a critical part of practicing **automation, scalability, and transparency** in my work.

## üìù Features  

- **Blog:** Articles and deep dives on tools, technologies, and lessons from my projects.  
- **Documentation Archive:** Step-by-step breakdowns of my experiments, from Kubernetes to scripting.  
- **Continuous Improvement:** The repository and website evolve as I explore new ideas and technologies.
