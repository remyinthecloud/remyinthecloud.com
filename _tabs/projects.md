Here are a few data projects where I've applied analysis, visualization, and cloud tools to solve real-world problems and deliver business value.

### 🏭 Data Warehouse for Mock Etsy Shop Data
This initiative demonstrates the principles of modern data engineering using a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), robust ETL pipelines with PostgreSQL running in Docker, and includes best practices in data ingestion, transformation, quality validation, and reporting. Version control is managed via GitHub, project planning is tracked in Notion, and architecture is documented with Draw.io.

The dataset mimics real-world CRM and ERP sources delivered as CSV files, and the project showcases how to integrate disparate data sources into a single warehouse optimized for analysis and stakeholder reporting.

### 📊 Sales Performance Dashboard
Built an automated dashboard in AWS QuickSight powered by S3, Athena, and Glue. Enabled real-time tracking of regional sales KPIs for the marketing team.

### 📈 Web Traffic & Behavior Analysis
Collected and analyzed website traffic data using Google Analytics and Python. Identified user drop-off points and recommended UX improvements that boosted engagement.
